# Formulae translation

Project for the Deep Learning course at the University of Bologna (2024/2025).

## Description
It's an autoregressive Transformer encode-decoder model implemented in Keras for transforming formulae from infix to postfix notation. 

## Results
The task was a simple one, because of it few parameters were enough to reach the score of 1/1, with the evaluation measure provided in the notebook.
